                <p>Hello! I am a 20 year old living in Seattle with my parents and my two cats! Before getting my current cats, Aster and Lyra, I snuck home a cat and it somehow almost worked! He did need to be put down a month after getting him, but I'm happy I was able to give him a happy last month of life that he wouldn't have had at the shelter. Animals are very important to me! While my parents will not allow me to foster any animals with I'm living under their roof, my goal in life is to retire to become a full time animal foster parent. Untill that time, I will be seeking out a career in programing.</p>
